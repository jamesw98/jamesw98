### Recent Projects

**[SimpleGrader](https://github.com/jamesw98/simple-grader)**: A versatile tool for grading student coding assignment submissions. A work in progress, currently working on getting a Docker image built so it can be run on any system  

**[DnD-Bot](https://github.com/jamesw98/dnd-bot)**: A Discord bot written in Python to help in playing Dungeons and Dragons. This was my side project during COVID lockdown. Can roll dice, track initiative, store and load character sheets and spell books, and search for a variety of D&D topics. 

**Virginia Tech Grading Tools**: Similar to my Simple-Grader project, but written specifically for Virginia Tech. Written for David Mcpherson for [CS3304](https://cs.vt.edu/Undergraduate/courses/CS3304.html) and [CS2505](https://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs2505/spring2020/). This tool lets instructors download submissions from Canvas, grade the submissions with a reference solution, and upload the grade and feedback to the assignment on Canvas.
